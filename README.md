# SupaClicker Hack
A script to obtain the desired statistics on the [SupaClicker](https://github.com/Steellgold/supa-clicker) game.

To use the script, you need to connect to the game's website and retrieve the list of your cookies in the headers of a Network request to set the `COOKIES` variable in an `.env` at the project root.

`.env` example:
```php
COOKIES="sb-ludyyxcyrqfzlwhexilp-auth-token-code-verifier=...; sb-ludyyxcyrqfzlwhexilp-auth-token=..."
```
